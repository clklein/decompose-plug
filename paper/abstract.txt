A Semantics for Context-Sensitive Reduction Semantics
Casey Klein, Jay McCarthy, Steven Jaconette, Robert Bruce Findler

This paper explores Felleisen-Hieb-style operational semantics from a
term rewriting perspective. More precisely, it contains a formalism
system that gives a meaning for evaluation-context based semantics,
specifically showing how to interpret decomposition and plugging
formally. The semantics is not naturally algorithmic, so the paper
also gives an algorithm for matching and proves that the algorithm
matches the semantics.

The work is inspired by PLT Redex, a domain-specific programming
language for operational semantics and it draws heavily on our
experience building operational semantics and struggling to nail down
how a semantics behaves.
