A Semantics for Context-Sensitive Reduction Semantics
Casey Klein, Jay McCarthy, Steven Jaconette, Robert Bruce Findler

This paper explores the semantics of the meta-notation used in the
style of operational semantics introduced by Felleisen and Hieb.
Specifically, it defines a formal system that gives precise meanings
to the notions of contexts, decomposition, and plugging (or
recomposition) left implicit in most expositions. This semantics is
not naturally algorithmic, so the paper also provides an algorithm and
proves a correspondence with the declarative definition.

The motivation for this investigation is PLT Redex, a domain-specific
programming language designed to support Felleisen-Hieb-style
definitions with minimal changes from the conventional
pencil-and-paper notation. Since Redex's first release, its semantics
for contexts as changed several times, as we repeatedly encountered
reduction systems that did not behave according to their authors'
intent. The work describes the result of that experience.
