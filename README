This repository provides a semantics for context-sensitive reduction
semantics. See http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/plug/.

The `semantics' directory contains a Redex encoding of the semantics.

The `aplas2011' directory contains the Scribble source for the paper
describing the semantics, including the paper's examples.

The `pld-talk' contains the Slideshow source for Robby Findler's PLD
2011 talk about the project.

TODO: the semantics in figure 11 has been updated to deal with
'hide-hole', but the running text hasn't. The current Casey/Robby
consensus is that if we get cons chaperones, then the model in the
paper is what we should do in Redex proper. If not, then Casey
believes that we want something closer to the version of Redex in 5.2,
which doesn't have explicit paths in the contexts, but instead
requires searching for the hole to determine if something is a
context. The advantage being that 'match' still works for processing
terms (using quasiquote patterns).
