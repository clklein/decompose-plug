Matching Contexts

Redex is a domain-specific language for writing, testing, and
typesetting operational semantics (and related tasks). Linguistically,
however, the most interesting part of Redex is its pattern
matcher. More interesting, in fact, that we realized when we started
working on it. Specifically, Redex's pattern language has a notion of
context-sensitive matching, inspired by Felleisen/Hieb-style
semantics. As it turns out, the precise semantics of context
decomposition has not been nailed down anywhere and is pretty subtle.

This talk explores the design space for the semantics of the pattern
matching and tries to bring across how rich it is, how to best make
sense of decomposition as it is currently bring practiced, and how
to design a programming language around it.
